-----

The [examples](examples/example.php) are a good place to start. The minimal you'll need to
have is:
```php
require 'passslot-php-sdk/src/PassSlot.php';

$engine = PassSlot::start('<YOUR APP KEY>');
$pass = $engine->createPassFromTemplate(<Template ID>);
$engine->redirectToPass($pass);
```
(Assuming you have already setup a template that does not require any values)
